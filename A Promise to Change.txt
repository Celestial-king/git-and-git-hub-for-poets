Ego and Resentment

I hate the way I've grown so cold,
How pride and ego took their hold,
I've hurt the ones I hold so dear,
With words of anger, born of fear.

The pieces left behind are few,
A shattered mirror, broken view.
But now I stand, my heart contrite,
I'll force this change, I’ll set things right.

No longer will I feed the flame,
Or cast around misplaced blame.
I swear this time, I'll choose the light,
Let go of darkness, end the fight.

I'll shed this skin of anger, pride,
And leave behind the part that lied.
With open hands, I'll let it go,
Become the self I long to know.

A promise made, a hope held tight,
That I won’t let my heart take flight.
And when the storm begins to rise,
I’ll keep my calm, I’ll silence cries.

For I am more than this I've been,
A soul reborn, a heart to mend.
No longer will I be confined,
To anger's chains—I’ll free my mind.

And with this vow, I’ll start anew,
A better self, a life more true.
