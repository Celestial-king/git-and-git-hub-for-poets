Ego and Resentment

I hate the way I've grown so cold,
How pride and ego took their hold,
I've hurt the ones I hold so dear,
With words of anger, born of fear.

The pieces left behind are few,
A shattered mirror, broken view.
But now I stand, my heart contrite,
I'll force this change, I’ll set things right.

No longer will I feed the flame,
Or cast around misplaced blame.
I swear this time, I'll choose the light,
Let go of darkness, end the fight.

I'll shed this skin of anger, pride,
And leave behind the part that lied.
With open hands, I'll let it go,
Become the self I long to know.

A promise made, a hope held tight,
That I won’t let my heart take flight.
And when the storm begins to rise,
I’ll keep my calm, I’ll silence cries.

For I am more than this I've been,
A soul reborn, a heart to mend.
No longer will I be confined,
To anger's chains—I’ll free my mind.

And with this vow, I’ll start anew,
A better self, a life more true.

The Shift in Me

The storm has passed, the skies are clear,
The weight I carried disappears.
The anger, pride—once held so tight,
Have slipped away, dissolved in light.

Some walked away, their chapter closed,
Their presence faded, but I’ve grown.
And in their place, new souls arrived,
With kindness, grace—I feel revived.

Good people came, with hearts of gold,
Their warmth a balm to what was cold.
They see in me the best I can be,
And through their eyes, I learn to see.

Their wisdom lifts, their laughter heals,
They’ve shown me love, made it real.
With them, I’ve found a path to peace,
A better version of release.

No longer bound by who I was,
I’ve let it go without a pause.
I’m free to grow, to move ahead,
No more regrets, no more unsaid.

These souls, they make me want to rise,
To meet the future with clear eyes.
With every step, I learn, I change,
And find that joy is no exchange.

I thank the ones who walked away,
They taught me what I couldn’t stay.
And those who came, they light the way,
To better nights, to brighter days.

The shift in me is plain to see,
A heart set free, at last, I’m me.
